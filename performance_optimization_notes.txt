Performance Optimization Notes
==============================

1. Indexes:
   - Created indexes on customer_id, product_id, and sale_date to improve JOIN and WHERE clause performance.

2. Query Optimization:
   - Used GROUP BY and FETCH FIRST to limit result sets in analytic queries.
   - Aggregated by month using TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') to simplify trends.

3. View Usage:
   - Created reusable views for common reporting needs to avoid repetitive subqueries.

4. Partitioning (Optional):
   - Considered monthly partitioning on sale_date for large-scale sales data for performance on big datasets.

5. Statistics:
   - Gathered statistics on large tables using DBMS_STATS for better Oracle optimizer plans.
